&0=Aortic=@@ Relating to the aorta, which
is the major vessel that
carries oxygenated blood from
the heart to the body.
Sometimes this term is used to
denote the @@ valve, which
is the valve that prevents
back-flow of blood from the
aorta into the left ventricle.
(For example, "@@
stenosis.") 
&1=Artery=@@ A vessel that carries blood
away from the heart. Arteries
generally carry oxygenated
blood. In mammals, the
exception is the pulmonary
@@, which carries
deoxygenated blood to the
lungs. 
&2=Atrium=@@ The chamber of the heart that
collects blood returning from
the rest of the body. In all
vertebrates but fish, there
are two atria, left and right.
The right @@ collects
deoxygenated blood from the
body and passes it to the
right ventricle. The left
@@ collects oxygenated
blood from the lungs and
passes it to the left
ventricle. 
&3=Coronary=@@ Relating to the heart, or to
one of the two arteries that
originate in the aorta and
supply blood directly to heart
tissue. 
&4=Mitral Valve=@@ Valve that separates the left
atrium and the left ventricle
and prevents back-flow from
the ventricle to the atrium.
Derived from "miter," which it
resembles. (A miter is a tall,
pointed hat with peaks in
front and back which is worn
by a bishop.) 
&5=Pulmonary=@@ Relating to the lungs.
Sometimes this term is used to
denote the @@ valve,
which is the valve that
prevents back-flow of blood
from the @@ artery into
the right ventricle. (For
example, "@@
regurgitation.") 
&6=Tricuspid Valve=@@ Valve that separates the
right atrium and the right
ventricle and prevents
back-flow from the ventricle
to the atrium. It is composed
of three leaf-like parts. 
&7=Vein=@@ A vessel that carries blood
toward the heart. 
&8=Ventricle=@@ The chamber of the heart that
is responsible for pumping
blood out to the rest of the
body. In mammals and birds,
there are two @@s, left
and right. The right @@
pumps deoxygenated blood to
the lungs via the pulmonary
artery; the left @@
pumps oxygenated blood to the
body via the aorta. 
Anemia 
&9=Aneurysm=@@ A pathological blood-filled
dilatation of a blood vessel. 
&10=Angina pectoris=@@ Chest pain caused by
insufficient blood flow to the
heart muscle. 
&11=Arrhythmia=@@Irregular heartbeat. 
&12=Atherosclerosis=@@ An accumulation of
fat-containing deposits on
arterial walls. 
&13=Bradycardia=@@Excessively slow heartbeat. 
&14=Cyanosis=@@ A condition in which a
person's skin is discolored to
a bluish hue because of
inadequate oxygenation of the
blood. 
&15=Diastole=@@ Normal period of relaxation
and dilatation of the heart
cavities. 
&16=Dilatation=@@ the condition of being
abnormally dilated or
enlarged. 
&17=Dyspnea=@@Difficulty in breathing. 
&18=Cardiomyopathy=@@ This is the general term for
diseases of the heart muscle.
The most common of these
diseases is the dilated
@@ in which the
disease weakens the heart
muscle and causes left
ventricular dilation leading
to increased diastolic
pressure and volume. 
&19=Hypertension=@@ A condition in which a
person's blood pressure is
abnormally high. For normal
adults, the pressure should be
less than 130 mmHg systolic
and less than 85 mmHg
diastolic. Pressures above
140/90 indicate a mild form of
@@; above 180/110 is
considered severe. 
&20=Insufficiency=@@ Describes a condition in
which a valve is not able to
prevent back-flow of blood.
The resulting back-flow is
termed a regurgitation. 
&21=Ischemia=@@ Localized loss of blood
supply due to a mechanical
obstruction. 
&22=Prolapse=@@ Floppy valve, associated with
regurgitation. 
&23=Regurgitation=@@ Back-flow of blood through an
insufficient valve. (For
example, mitral valve
@@.) 
&24=Stenosis=@@ Constriction of a passage.
Used typically when there is a
narrowing of a valve opening
(for example, mitral valve
@@) or of a blood
vessel. 
&25=Syncope=@@ A brief loss of consciousness
caused by temporary lack of
oxygenated blood. 
&26=Systole=@@ Period of contraction of the
heart during which blood is
ejected from the ventricles. 
&27=Tachycardia=@@Excessively rapid heartbeat. 
&28=Phenotype=@@ The observed properties or
outward appearance of a trait. 
&29=Genotype=@@ The genetic makeup of an
organism with regard to the
trait. 
&30=Gene=@@ The unit of inheritance. A
segment of DNA that provides
the code for assembling a
specific protein. 
&31=Penetrance=@@ The probability that a
disease phenotype will appear
when a disease-related
genotype is present. 
&32=Expressivity=@@ The range of phenotypic
variation that is present. For
example, disease symptoms can
be mild to severe in form.
